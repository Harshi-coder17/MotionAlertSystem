# MotionAlertSystem 🚨

A simple motion detection system using a PIR sensor with Arduino. When motion is detected, it triggers an LED and a buzzer for alerting purposes.

## Components Used
- Arduino Uno
- PIR Motion Sensor
- LED
- Buzzer
- Jumper Wires
- Breadboard

## How It Works
The PIR sensor detects movement. If motion is detected:
- LED turns ON
- Buzzer beeps for 0.5 seconds

If no motion is detected, both the LED and buzzer turn OFF.
